# ACME - The Fake Store
This project is a Next.js-based demo / classroom project. It showcases a small fictional “ACME” company website offering “Smart solutions, zero hassle” and includes:

- A product listing interface (“Products”)
- A contact page (“Contact us”)
- A “fake store” integration (backend or mock API)
- Basic branding, layout, and styling to illustrate how to build a small real-world Next.js app 

The goal is to provide a base of the coding of Next.js.

## Features/Pages
Here are the main features and pages visible in the demo:

- Home / Landing – “ACME – Smart solutions, zero hassle” headline, with navigation to Products and Contact 
- Products – A page that shows product listings (pulled from some “Fakestore” or product API) 
- Contact – A contact form or contact info page
- Branding / Styling – Uses a clean, modern layout, likely with CSS modules, Tailwind, or standard CSS (depending on project)
- Demo integration – The “Fakestore” reference suggests integration with a mock or third-party product API or dataset 

Because it’s a demo project, the scope is modest but enough to illustrate routing, data fetching, page layout, navigation, and basic styling in Next.js.

## Tech Stack
- Framework: Next.js (React + server/client rendering) 
- Language: TypeScript (mostly) with some JavaScript
- Styling / Fonts: Uses next/font to optimize and load a custom font family (Geist) 
- Build / Tooling: Standard Next.js setup (ESLint, PostCSS, etc.) 
- Deployment: Hosted on Vercel (the domain is nextjsinclass.vercel.app)
